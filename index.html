    <p>My name is Peyton Shelton and I am a <strong>mechanical engineer</strong> major.
	I am a freshman at <ins>North Carolina State University.</ins>
	I chose to be a mechanical engineer major because I like math, <em>drawing</em>, and coming up with designs</p>
<br/>
	<f2>This past summer I worked in a tire shop that is located in my home town.
	I enjoyed my time there but the work was really hard.
	I changed tires, rotated tires, and plugged flat tires throughout the day.</f2>
