    <p>My name is Peyton Shelton and I am a mechanical engineer major.
	I am a freshman at North Carolina State University.
	I chose to be a mechanical engineer major because I like math, drawing, and coming up with designs</p>
<br></br>
	<p>This past summer I worked in a tire shop that is located in my home town.
	I enjoyed my time there but the work was really hard.
	I changed tires, rotated tires, and plugged flat tires throughout the day.</p>
